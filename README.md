I made this personal project to explore wave function collapse algorithms after i was inspired by [The Coding Train's Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM). My algorithm creates an nxn grid of tiles, consisting of 5 images in 12 total orientations, such that all of the tiles fit together like pieces of a puzzle.
As an example, here are some images from a tileset that I created

When put together, they create an aestetically pleasing composite image that looks like this.

You are more than welcome to fork this repository and add your own touches to it, and if you wanted to make your own tilesets, follow [these guidelines](https://ethantomb.github.io/wave-function-collapse/tilesets.html) and send them my way on linkedin or twitter or through github. In fact, if you did this, it would genuinely make my day!
